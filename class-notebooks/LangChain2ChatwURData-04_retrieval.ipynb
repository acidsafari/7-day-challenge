Although many people used to th ink it's not possible to take a single \\nimage and build a 3D model, but using a lear ning algorithm and that sort of clustering \\nalgorithm is the first step.

So again, taking th e same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \\nthe same sort of unsupervised learning algor ithm, you can group the pixels into different \\nregions.
